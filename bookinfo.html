                    FROM THE BACK COVER<br>
                    <br>
                    Dear Reader,<br>
                    <br>
                    If you&#8217;re holding this book, then you probably have 
                    an interest in either Java programming or wireless communication. 
                    This book covers a hands-on approach on how to develop Bluetooth 
                    applications using the Java programming language. Don&#8217;t 
                    worry if you&#8217;re new to Bluetooth, because we provide 
                    a concise tutorial of the Bluetooth protocol in initial chapters 
                    of this book. This book also provides extensive detail on 
                    how to use the official Java Bluetooth API (the JSR-82) and 
                    shows you<br>
                    <br>
                    * How to turn your Bluetooth-enabled phone or PDA into a Bluetooth 
                    network browser<br>
                    * How to turn a desktop PC into a Bluetooth print server<br>
                    * How transfer files between two Bluetooth devices<br>
                    * How to set up and configure a Bluetooth network simulator<br>
                    * How to encrypt your data transmissions<br>
                    <br>
                    In the last three chapters of the book, we provide information 
                    on three hardware devices that have Bluetooth and Java built-in: 
                    the SND Micro BlueTarget, the Ericsson BlipNet, and the PsiNaptic 
                    PsiNode (which is a Jini-Bluetooth device).<br>
                    In the appendices of the book, we&#8217;ve also included a 
                    getting started guide on how to develop Java Bluetooth applications 
                    on the Palm OS platform, as well as API listings of the JSR-82 
                    API and the Ericsson BlipNet API.<br>
                    <br>
                    We hope that you enjoy the book, <br>

                    <strong>Chapter 1: Introducing Bluetooth</strong>: If you&#8217;re 
                    completely new to Bluetooth, then this chapter is for you. 
                    In Chapter 1, we give a brief introduction to Bluetooth, with 
                    a general explanation of what you can do with the technology.<br>
                    </font><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
                    <strong>Chapter 2: Bluetooth 1.1</strong>: In this chapter, 
                    we dive right into the dirty details of the Bluetooth protocol. 
                    Here we define the roles and relationships between the Bluetooth 
                    stack, Bluetooth profiles, and Bluetooth hardware. If you&#8217;ve 
                    seen Bluetooth terminology before, but you don&#8217;t know 
                    the difference between SDP and SDAP for instance, then this 
                    chapter will help clear things up.<br>

                    3: Before You Get Started</a></strong>: Chapter 3 is very 
                    appropriately named because it covers all the loose ends that 
                    need to be addressed before we show you how to integrate Bluetooth 
                    and Java.<br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Chapter 4: Understanding the Java Bluetooth API</strong>: 
                    This chapter covers the full life cycle of a Bluetooth application 
                    (whether you&#8217;re using Java or not). This chapter also 
                    shows you how to use the javax.bluetooth package of the official 
                    Java Bluetooth API (the JSR-82) in order to create Bluetooth 
                    applications.<br>
                    <strong><br>
                    Chapter 5: Bluetooth with J2ME MIDP</strong>: The first complete 
                    example of a Java Bluetooth application is explained in Chapter 
                    5. Before we present the code, however, we provide a short 
                    review of the J2ME MIDP.<br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Chapter 6: Creating a Bluetooth Print Server with 
                    the JPS API</strong>: Now with a complete example under your 
                    belt, things will start to get pretty exciting. In Chapter 
                    6, we introduce you to the Java Printing API and show you 
                    how to create a Bluetooth print server.<br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Chapter 7: Java and OBEX</strong>: Chapter 7 covers 
                    the foundation of the OBEX protocol, and provides an example 
                    on how to transfer files using the javax.obex package of the 
                    JSR-82.<br>
                    <strong><br>
                    Chapter 8: Using a Bluetooth Simulator</strong>: As you might 
                    have guessed, this chapter is all about how to create Java 
                    applications that interact with virtual Bluetooth devices. 
                    In this chapter, the entire Bluetooth network is simulated 
                    in software.<br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Chapter 9: Bluetooth Security</strong>: Chapter 9 
                    covers the security measures provided by the Bluetooth specification 
                    in order to make wireless applications more secure.<br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Chapter 10: Wireless Embedded Systems with the Micro 
                    BlueTarget</strong>: The primary focus of Chapter 10 is the 
                    Micro BlueTarget by Smart Network Devices. In this chapter, 
                    we explore the possibilities of creating applications with 
                    a fully functional computer that fits in your hand and includes 
                    an implementation of the JSR-82.<br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Chapter 11: Enterprise Bluetooth Applications with 
                    the Ericsson BlipNet</strong>: In Chapter 11, we introduce 
                    you to enterprise Bluetooth applications and show you how 
                    to construct them using Java and the Ericsson BlipNet.<br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Chapter 12: Bluetooth and Jini</strong>: In the final 
                    chapter of the book, we provide an overview of Jini network 
                    technology and describe how to implement Jini and Bluetooth 
                    together.<br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Appendix A: javax.bluetooth</strong>: Appendix A is 
                    a handy reference that contains all the method signatures 
                    of the javax.bluetooth API.<br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Appendix B: javax.obex</strong>: Appendix B is a handy 
                    reference that contains all the method signatures of the javax.obex 
                    API.<br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Appendix C: Java Bluetooth Development on the PalmOS 
                    Platform</strong>: Appendix C provides a quick overview of 
                    how to get started creating Java Bluetooth applications on 
                    the Palm OS platform.<br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Appendix D: BlipNet 1.1 API</strong>: Appendix D contains 
                    full descriptions of the classes, exceptions, and interfaces 
                    that comprise the BlipNet API. This appendix will be really 
                    useful to have on hand when developing BlipNet applications.</font></p>
